# Schematics
In this folder you can view schematic made with [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/) and ready exported Gerber to upload for production facilities like JLCPCB, the size of the PCB was designed for this [DIN Rail Box](https://ebmstore.it/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=643).
for select the module address you have to set the jumpers like reported on image below:



The main board is "modulo MCU" that use:
